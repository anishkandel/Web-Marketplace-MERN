            <p>Contact us pages. Everyone has them, needs them, but are you really paying attention to the strategy behind them?

It’s true isn’t it? One of the most valuable pages on your website is usually an afterthought. It’s one of those things that has to be there, but often enough, you throw the necessary information on and leave it at that. What a waste!

The page name itself is a call-to-action; Treat it with some respect.

Contact us pages are often the go-to for a new visitor on a mission. It’s where they go when they have a question and truly want to speak to an individual at your organization.

They exist to serve the user with the purpose of providing them with information on how they can get in touch with you.

The goal of every contact us page is to convert by clearly and effectively presenting the method(s) of getting in touch with a company as quickly as possible. </p>
